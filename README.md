# basic-text-editor

A basic Text Editor created using Java and Swing.

## Functionalities Included:
 - A 1920x1080 window
 - Loading text files from hard drive for editing
 - Finding occurrences of a specific string using the search bar on the editor window
 - Saving file to hard drive

## Working Explained:
 1. Once the Text Editor is launched, the Menu Bar, Search Bar along with the search options and the Editor window will be displayed.

<p align="center">
 <img src = "./images/readme/editor.png?raw=true" width=66%>
</p>
</p>
 2. One can just begin typing in to create a new file, just like in Notepad. Otherwise, choose the 'Open' option from the File Menu to load a file of supported format, for editing / searching.
<p>
<p align="center">
 <img src = "./images/readme/open_menu.png?raw=true" width=50%>
 <br>
 <br>
 <img src = "./images/readme/open_browse.png?raw=true" width=66%>
</p>
</p>
 3. Once the file is loaded in, any and all changes can be made directly to the text. For searching, use the Search Bar above the editor window to search for a string in the file. Choose the Search, Prev and Next buttons to go through the file and search for occurrences of the given string.

<p align="center">
 <img src = "./images/readme/search_menu.png?raw=true" width=50%>

 <br>
